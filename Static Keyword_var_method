//Static variable is a one which is shared by all objects --- > Static var should be access in a static way (to access with class name )

//Static Block contains Static variable 

class School{
    String std ;
    static String section;
    String stud_name ;

    public void showDetails(){
      System.out.println("The student name is : " + stud_name + " And Section is : " + section + " And Standard is : " + std);
    }
    //static block contains static variable , which is common for all the objects .
    static {
       section = "B" ;
    }

}
class Hello {
  public static void main (String args[]){
    School a = new School();
    a.stud_name = "Ilakkiya";
    a.std = "X";

    School b = new School();
    b.stud_name = "Kavya";
    b.std = "XII";
    
    a.showDetails();
    b.showDetails();

    School.section = "D";
   
  }
}

O/P :
The student name is : Ilakkiya And Section is : B And Standard is : X
The student name is : Kavya And Section is : B And Standard is : XII

[Here the static block is assigned with section value as "B" , So it is commonly taken by both objects 'a' and 'b']

O/P :
The student name is : Ilakkiya And Section is : B And Standard is : X
The student name is : Kavya And Section is : B And Standard is : XII
