// Regular Expression :
A regular expression is a sequence of character that creates a search pattern .When you search for a data in a text you can use this search pattern to identify what you are looking on .

^[a-z0-9_-]{3-15}$
^                -> start of the line
[a-z0-9_-]       -> contains letters , numbers , underscore , hyphen 
3-15             -> 3 - 5 characters long 
$                -> End Of the line 

So simple example : suppose if 'act' is my regex pattern then I will use this to search in a string which contains act
Assume sentence : I love to act and interact with people but sometime I react quickly . 

The above sentence contains act , interact , react which contains 'act' in it .
