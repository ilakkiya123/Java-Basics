Abstract : 
1)Abstarct method - only the declaration of the method is present .To indicate that we provide an abstract keyword .
          -> abstract public void drive();
2)Abstract method should be present in an abstract class 
          ->abstract class Car { }
3)An Object cannot be created for an abstract class .
4)The newly created class which extends from Car should mandatoriy define the abstract method of parent class .If it cannot define then it also should given with prefix of abstract.
5)Abstract class - method declaration is present . Concrete class - method definition of abstract method is present 

abstract class Car{
abstract public void drive();
abstract public void accelerate();
public void playMusic(){
  System.out.println("Playing Music ....");
}
}
abstract class Zen extends Car{
   public void drive(){
    System.out.println("Zens drives ::: ");
   }
}

//Concrete Class
class ZenEstilo extends Zen{
  public void accelerate(){
    System.out.println("Speed gets increased ...");
  }
}

class Hello {
  public static void main (String args[]){
   Car c1 = new ZenEstilo();
   c1.drive();
   c1.playMusic();
   c1.accelerate();
  }
}

Note :
Abstract class can have both abstract method and non abstract method .
It can have only abstract method 
It can have only non abstract method .
