4 Pillars Of OOPS :

DATA ABSTRACTION :
---> It hides the internal implementation and shows only the essential functionality to the user .
---> It can be achieved through Interface and Abstract Classes .
---> Increases Security and Confidentiality .
---> Cellphone - How call is made is abstracted and only the green button to make Call is visible .

ENCAPSULATION :
---> Encapsulation bundles the data and code working on that in a single unit called class .
---> Also known as Data Hiding .
---> Steps to achieve Encapsulation ,
    ---> declare a variable as private 
    ---> provide public getters and setters to modify and view the value of the variable 
---> Loosely Coupled Code and Better access control & security .

INHERITANCE :
---> Capacity of a Class to inherit the properties from a Parent Class .
---> It can inherit both method and variables from the parent , so no need to rewrite again .
---> It can be achieved through extends keyword or through interface .
---> Types :
      -> Single Inheritance 
      -> Multiple Inheritance 
      -> Hierarchial Inheritance 
      -> Multilevel Inheritance (Diamond problem issue is resolved by interface )
---> Code Reusability and polymorphism is achieved by Inheritance. 

POLYMORPHISM :
---> Poly means many , Morphism means Form 
---> A same method behaves differently in different situation .
---> A person can be a Father , Friend , Husband plays different role .Similar water - solid , liquid , gas .
---> Types 
      -> Compile Time Polymorphism 
      -> Run Time Polymorphism
