4 Pillars Of OOPS :

DATA ABSTRACTION :
---> It hides the internal implementation and shows only the essential functionality to the user .
---> It can be achieved through Interface and Abstract Classes .
---> Increases Security and Confidentiality .
---> Cellphone - How call is made is abstracted and only the green button to make Call is visible .
